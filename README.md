# logAnalyzer

I've created this repo to try the features proposed from the [logpai team](http://www.logpai.com).
What they are offering is some repos that are meant to analyze different server's logs.
This repo groups all their repos in one:

- [Loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub): where you can find all the available datasets;
- [Logparser](https://github.com/logpai/logparser): where you can find all the available datasets parsers to convert logs into structured datas;
- [Loglizer](https://github.com/logpai/loglizer): where you can find all the different models to analyze the log_structured;

In the project root you can find some working examples and a benchmark for all the analyzers.

Have fun :)
